These systems’s adoption has been expanding, accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society, meaning that algorithmically informed decisions have greater potential for signiﬁcant social impact. However, most of these accurate decision support systems remain complex black boxes, meaning their internal logic and inner workings are hidden to the user and even experts cannot fully understand the rationale behind their predictions. Moreover, new regulations and highly regulated domains have made the audit and veriﬁability of decisions mandatory, increasing the demand for the ability to question, understand, and trust machine learning systems, for which interpretability is indispensable. The research community has recognized this interpretability problem and focused on developing both interpretable models and explanation methods over the past few years. However, the emergence of these methods shows there is no consensus on how to assess the explanation quality. Which are the most suitable metrics to assess the quality of an explanation? The aim of this article is to provide a review of the current state of the research ﬁeld on machine learning interpretability while focusing on the societal impact and on the developed methods and metrics. Furthermore, a complete literature review is presented in order to identify future directions of work on this ﬁeld.}, number={8}, journal={Electronics}, author={Carvalho, Diogo V. and Pereira, Eduardo M. and Cardoso, Jaime S.}, year={2019}, month={Jul}, pages={832} }

Deep learning is the most effective, supervised, time and cost efficient machine learning approach. Deep learning is not a restricted learning approach, but it abides various procedures and topographies which can be applied to an immense speculum of complicated problems. The technique learns the illustrative and differential features in a very stratified way. Deep learning methods have made a significant breakthrough with appreciable performance in a wide variety of applications with useful security tools. It is considered to be the best choice for discovering complex architecture in high-dimensional data by employing back propagation algorithm. As deep learning has made significant advancements and tremendous performance in numerous applications, the widely used domains of deep learning are business, science and government which further includes adaptive testing, biological image classification, computer vision, cancer detection, natural language processing, object detection, face recognition, handwriting recognition, speech recognition, stock market analysis, smart city and many more. This paper focuses on the concepts of deep learning, its basic and advanced architectures, techniques, motivational aspects, characteristics and the limitations. The paper also presents the major differences between the deep learning, classical machine learning and conventional learning approaches and the major challenges ahead. The main intention of this paper is to explore and present chronologically, a comprehensive survey of the major applications of deep learning covering variety of areas, study of the techniques and architectures used and further the contribution of that respective application in the real world. Finally, the paper ends with the conclusion and future aspects.}, journal={Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering}, author={Dargan, Shaveta and Kumar, Munish and Ayyagari, Maruthi Rohit and Kumar, Gulshan}, year={2019}, month={Jun} }

 @article{gan_2014, title={Generative Adversarial Networks}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661}, abstractNote={We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.}, note={arXiv: 1406.2661}, journal={arXiv:1406.2661 [cs, stat]}, author={Goodfellow, Ian J. and Pouget-Abadie, Jean and Mirza, Mehdi and Xu, Bing and Warde-Farley, David and Ozair, Sherjil and Courville, Aaron and Bengio, Yoshua}, year={2014}, month={Jun} }

It provides a taxonomy of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and furnish the reader with knowledge of current and emerging trends in ANN applications research and area of focus for researchers. Additionally, the study presents ANN application challenges, contributions, compare performances and critiques methods. The study covers many applications of ANN techniques in various disciplines which include computing, science, engineering, medicine, environmental, agriculture, mining, technology, climate, business, arts, and nanotechnology, etc. The study assesses ANN contributions, compare performances and critiques methods. The study found that neural-network models such as feedforward and feedback propagation artificial neural networks are performing better in its application to human problems. Therefore, we proposed feedforward and feedback propagation ANN models for research focus based on data analysis factors like accuracy, processing speed, latency, fault tolerance, volume, scalability, convergence, and performance. Moreover, we recommend that instead of applying a single method, future research can focus on combining ANN models into one network-wide application."

As a result of the weight adjustments, internal 'hidden' units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},

abstract = "In this paper, we consider the robust interpretation of Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas over signals that take values in metric spaces. For such signals, which are generated by systems whose states are equipped with non-trivial metrics, for example continuous or hybrid, robustness is not only natural, but also a critical measure of system performance. Thus, we propose multi-valued semantics for MTL formulas, which capture not only the usual Boolean satisfiability of the formula, but also topological information regarding the distance, ε, from unsatisfiability. We prove that any other signal that remains ε-close to the initial one also satisfies the same MTL specification under the usual Boolean semantics. Finally, our framework is applied to the problem of testing formulas of two fragments of MTL, namely Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) and closed Metric Temporal Logic (clMTL), over continuous-time signals using only discrete-time analysis. The motivating idea behind our approach is that if the continuous-time signal fulfills certain conditions and the discrete-time signal robustly satisfies the temporal logic specification, then the corresponding continuous-time signal should also satisfy the same temporal logic specification."

Beside autonomous vehicle management, an important research focus is on the cooperation behaviour management. In this paper, we propose hybrid automaton modelling to emulate flexible vehicle Platoon and vehicles cooperation interactions. We introduce novel coding function for Platoon cooperation behaviour profile generation in time, which depends of vehicles number in Platoon and behaviour types. As the behaviour prediction of transportation systems, one of the primarily used methods of artificial intelligence in Intelligent Transport Systems, we propose an approach towards NARX neural network prediction of Platoon cooperation behaviour profile. With incorporation of Platoon manoeuvres dynamic prediction, which is capable of analysing traffic behaviour, this approach would be useful for secure implementation of real autonomous vehicles cooperation.}, number={3}, journal={Tehnicki vjesnik - Technical Gazette}, author={Lejla Banjanovic-Mehmedovic and Ivana Butigan and Fahrudin Mehmedovic and Mehmed Kantardzic}, year={2018}, month={Jun} }


@article{platooning_survey, title={A Survey on Platoon-Based Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems}, volume={18}, ISSN={1553-877X}, DOI={10.1109/COMST.2015.2410831}, abstractNote={Vehicles on the road with some common interests can cooperatively form a platoon-based driving pattern, in which a vehicle follows another one and maintains a small and nearly constant distance to the preceding vehicle. It has been proved that, compared to driving individually, such a platoon-based driving pattern can signiﬁcantly improve the road capacity and energy efﬁciency. Moreover, with the emerging vehicular adhoc network (VANET), the performance of platoon in terms of road capacity, safety and energy efﬁciency, etc., can be further improved. On the other hand, the physical dynamics of vehicles inside the platoon can also affect the performance of VANET. Such a complex system can be considered as a platoon-based vehicular cyber-physical system (VCPS), which has attracted signiﬁcant attention recently. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on platoon-based VCPS. We ﬁrst review the related work of platoon-based VCPS. We then introduce two elementary techniques involved in platoon-based VCPS: the vehicular networking architecture and standards, and trafﬁc dynamics, respectively. We further discuss the fundamental issues in platoon-based VCPS, including vehicle platooning/clustering, cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), platoon-based vehicular communications, etc., and all of which are characterized by the tight coupled relationship between trafﬁc dynamics and VANET behaviors. Since system veriﬁcation is critical to VCPS development, we also give an overview of VCPS simulation tools. Finally, we share our view on some open issues that may lead to new research directions.}, number={1}, journal={IEEE Communications Surveys \& Tutorials}, author={Jia, Dongyao and Lu, Kejie and Wang, Jianping and Zhang, Xiang and Shen, Xuemin}, year={2016}, pages={263–284} }
